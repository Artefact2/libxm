libxm
=====

A small XM (FastTracker II Extended Module) player library. Main
features:

* Small size in mind; many features can be disabled at compile-time,
  or are optimized out by the compiler if not used.

* Timing functions for synchronising against specific instruments,
  samples or channels.

* Samples can be loaded and altered at run-time, making it possible to
  use libxm with softsynths or other real-time signal processors.

Written in C11 and released under the WTFPL license, version 2.

Size
====

The playback routine (assuming the non-portable `.libxm` format is
loaded, see `libxmize` below) fits in under 7KiB of compressed
machine code.

`libxmize` and the non-portable format
======================================

The `libxmize` binary can convert a standard `.xm` file to a
non-standard, non-portable representation of that module. The file
generated by `libxmize` is usually a lot larger than the original
module, but has better compressibility.

In addition, the non-portable format:

* requires less code to load (`xm_create_context_from_libxmize()`
  instead of `xm_create_context()`) and thus can be used to produce
  smaller binaries. (See the size section above.)

* requires significantly less memory to play back modules (only
  kilobytes thanks to `mmap()`, see `libxmtoau` for an example).

The data generated by `libxmize` will not be readable:

* On a different CPU architecture
* On a different libxm commit
* On a libxm compiled with another compiler
* On a libxm compiled with a different compiler version
* On a libxm compiled with different options or CFLAGS

Examples
========

Some example programs are provided.

* `xmgl` is a music visualiser that uses OpenGL and JACK for very
  precise audio synchronisation. See a demo here:
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZkhl6XBUVM> and
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zBJ5aeOMeE> or something similar
  that runs in the browser:
  [libxm.js](https://artefact2.github.io/libxm.js/).

* `xmprocdemo`: see [README](./examples/xmprocdemo/README.md)

* `xmtoalsa` is a simple player that uses the ALSA library. It
  produces `xmp`-like output while playing. Use `xmtoalsa --help` (or
  check the source) to see the full usage.

  ~~~
  ./xmtoalsa --random **/*.xm
  ~~~

* `xmtowav` will play a module and output a `.wav` file.

  ~~~
  ./xmtowav my_module.xm my_module.wav
  ~~~

* `xmtoau` will play a module and output a `.au` file to standard
  output.

  ~~~
  mpv <(./xmtoau my_module.xm)
  ~~~

* `libxmtoau` is similar to `xmtoau`, except that it loads
  non-portable files generated by `libxmize`.

* `xmbench` is a benchmark program.

Here are some interesting modules, most showcase unusual or advanced
tracking techniques (and thus are a good indicator of a player's
accuracy):

* [Cerror - Expatarimental](http://modarchive.org/module.php?136603)
* [Lamb - Among the stars](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165819)
* [Raina - Cyberculosis](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165308)
* [Raina - Slumberjack](http://modarchive.org/module.php?148721)
* [Strobe - One for all](http://modarchive.org/module.php?161246)

Known issues
------------

* Only loads FastTracker II-compatible XM files.

* Loading a bogus file (that yet has a valid 60-byte header) will
  probably result in a segmentation fault.

* Big endian architectures are not yet supported.

Tests
=====

Some test XM files are in the `tests` directory. Their goal is to test
a certain feature against regressions. A summary of tests (and what
they are supposed to test) is in the table below.
