libxm
=====

A small XM (Fasttracker II Extended Module) player library. Main
features:

* Small and hackable: many features can be disabled at compile-time, or are
  optimized out by the compiler if not used. It is easy to bundle libxm in your
  game, demo, intro, etc.

* Fairly portable. Minimal dependencies (just libm). No memory allocations.
  Big-endian compatible (tested on s390x).

* Reasonable accuracy compared to Fasttracker 2. Deviations from FT2 playback,
  that aren't obviously bugs in FT2, are also libxm bugs.

* Can load most XM/MOD files, however playback accuracy of non-XM is
  best-effort.

* Timing functions for synchronising against specific instruments,
  samples or channels.

* Samples can be loaded and altered at run-time, making it possible to
  use libxm with softsynths or other real-time signal processors.

Written in C23 and released under the WTFPL license, version 2.

Building
========

* Build the library:

  ~~~
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -Bbuild -Ssrc
  make -C build
  ~~~

* Build a specific example:

  ~~~
  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -Bbuild-FOO -Sexamples/FOO
  make -C build-FOO
  ~~~

* To build a shared library and link dynamically, use
  `cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON`.

* To see a list of build options, use `cmake -L` or `cmake-gui`.

* To use libxm in your program, put these lines in the `CMakeLists.txt` of your  project, then `#include <xm.h>`:

  ~~~
  add_subdirectory(/path/to/libxm/src libxm_build)
  target_link_libraries(my_stuff PRIVATE xm)
  ~~~


Size
====

`libxmtoau` can be compiled (with all playback features enabled) and
[crushed](https://gitlab.com/artefact2/xzcrush) to about **4013 bytes** (Linux
x86_64).

~~~
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DXM_VERBOSE=OFF -DXM_LIBXM_DELTA_SAMPLES=OFF -DXM_LINEAR_INTERPOLATION=OFF -DXM_RAMPING=OFF -DXM_STRINGS=OFF -DXM_TIMING_FUNCTIONS=OFF -DXM_SAMPLE_TYPE=float -Bbuild-libxmize -Sexamples/libxmize
make -C build-libxmize libxmtoau
strip -R .eh_frame_hdr -R .eh_frame build-libxmize/libxmtoau
xzcrush build-libxmize/libxmtoau
~~~

If you are using libxm to play a single module (like in a demo/intro), disable
features as suggested by `libxmize` to save a few more bytes.

Examples
========

* [libxm.js](https://artefact2.github.io/libxm.js/) is a very simple
  XM player/visualiser that runs in a browser (emscripten port).

* `xmgl` is a simple music visualiser that uses OpenGL, GLFW and JACK for very
  precise audio synchronisation. See a demo here:
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR-fSa7J698>

* `xmprocdemo`: a simple non-interactive demo that plays back a single module
  with procedurally generated samples. Somewhat optimized for size. ([Dream
  Candy](https://modarchive.org/module.php?178565) by Drozerix, public domain.
  Thank you Drozerix for the great music!)

* `libxmize` converts a `.xm` module to the libxm format. It is highly
  non-portable and is meant for static linking and sizecoding (loading code is
  much shorter and libxm format compresses better).

* `libxmtoau` reads standard input (a file generated by `libxmize`) and
  writes a .AU file to standard output. Somewhat optimized for size, see [size
  section](#Size) above. You can test it with, for example,
  `libxmize file.xm | libxmtoau | mpv -`.

Here are some interesting modules, most showcase unusual or advanced
tracking techniques (and thus are a good indicator of a player's
accuracy):

* [Cerror - Expatarimental](http://modarchive.org/module.php?136603)
* [Lamb - Among the stars](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165819)
* [Raina - Cyberculosis](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165308)
* [Raina - Slumberjack](http://modarchive.org/module.php?148721)
* [Strobe - One for all](http://modarchive.org/module.php?161246)
* [Strobe - Paralysicical death](http://modarchive.org/module.php?65817)

Tests
=====

Some test XM files are in the `tests` directory. Their goal is to test
a certain feature against regressions.

A few tests can be automatically run:

~~~
cmake -Bbuild-tests -Stests
make -C build-tests all test
~~~

Other tests require manual checking, see the table below.

~~~
