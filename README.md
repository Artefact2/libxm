libxm
=====

A small XM (FastTracker II Extended Module) player library. Main
features:

* Small size in mind; many features can be disabled at compile-time,
  or are optimized out by the compiler if not used.

* Timing functions for synchronising against specific instruments,
  samples or channels.

* Samples can be loaded and altered at run-time, making it possible to
  use libxm with softsynths or other real-time signal processors.

* Should be fairly portable (only dependency is `libm`). The example programs
  mostly target Linux.

Written in C23 and released under the WTFPL license, version 2.

Size
====

`libxmtoau` can be compiled (with all playback features enabled) and
[crushed](https://gitlab.com/artefact2/xzcrush) to about **5272 bytes**.

If you are using libxm to play a single module (like in a demo/intro), disable
features as suggested by `libxmize` to save a few more bytes.

`libxmize` and the non-portable format
======================================

The `libxmize` binary can convert a standard `.xm` file to a non-standard,
non-portable representation of that module. The file generated by `libxmize` is
usually a lot larger than the original module, but has better compressibility
and loading it requires far less code.

The data generated by `libxmize` will not be readable:

* On a different CPU architecture
* On a different libxm commit
* On a libxm compiled with another compiler
* On a libxm compiled with a different compiler version
* On a libxm compiled with different options or CFLAGS

Examples
========

Some example programs are provided.

* [libxm.js](https://artefact2.github.io/libxm.js/) is a very simple
  XM player/visualiser that runs in a browser (emscripten port).

* `xmgl` is a simple music visualiser that uses OpenGL, GLFW and JACK for very
  precise audio synchronisation. See a demo here:
  <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR-fSa7J698>

* `xmprocdemo`: a simple non-interactive demo that plays back (using ALSA) a
  single module with procedurally generated samples.

* `libxmtoau` reads standard input (a file generated by `libxmize`) and
  writes a .AU file to standard output. Somewhat optimized for size, see [size
  section](#Size) above.

Here are some interesting modules, most showcase unusual or advanced
tracking techniques (and thus are a good indicator of a player's
accuracy):

* [Cerror - Expatarimental](http://modarchive.org/module.php?136603)
* [Lamb - Among the stars](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165819)
* [Raina - Cyberculosis](http://modarchive.org/module.php?165308)
* [Raina - Slumberjack](http://modarchive.org/module.php?148721)
* [Strobe - One for all](http://modarchive.org/module.php?161246)
* [Strobe - Paralysicical death](http://modarchive.org/module.php?65817)

Known issues
------------

* Only loads FastTracker II-compatible XM files.

* Loading a bogus file (that yet has a valid 60-byte header) will
  probably result in a segmentation fault.

* Big endian architectures are not yet supported.

Tests
=====

Some test XM files are in the `tests` directory. Their goal is to test
a certain feature against regressions. A summary of tests (and what
they are supposed to test) is in the table below.
